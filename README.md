# nitro-generator
This is a basic, but working script to search for avaible Discord Nitro links. Basically a bunch of it is coded by myself but not everything, so feel free to use it for yourself, but if you want to publish it, please link me or change the code a bit. (That also goes for the straight copy paster's ðŸ‘€)
