# Queqz Nitro Gen

This is a basic, but working script to search for avaible Discord Nitro (With proxies) and checks, if they're valid.

## Installation

For windows:

Open your cmd in the directory and then type:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Requirements

`Python` I don't know if any version works, but I tried it with "Python 3.12"

`The packages` The packages can be installed easily. (Take a look at the Installation section)

## Extra

I also added a converter for your proxies to get converted from "yourip" to "https://yourip". To use it, just paste your IP's in the in.txt in this format:

```bash
yourip
yourip
yourip
```

and then execute the main.py in your cmd.

## Warning
The proxies which are integrated in the script don't work anymore! For good proxies, type "proxies list" in github and dont buy any scammy subscriptions from websites!

Info: Basically a bunch of it is coded by myself but not everything, so feel free to use it for yourself, but if you want to publish it, please link me or change the code a bit. (That also goes to the straight copy paster's ðŸ‘€)
